## Notes
A fixed height for each column is needed as the filter function only returns one array and does not give use the array of arrays used to have multiple rows. As there is only one row we cannot change the display type on the divs as that makes them all be in one line.

The borders have also been removed and a box shadow is used so that there are no double borders and so that there is a full border on each column on all screen sizes.
